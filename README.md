## Abstract
This small tool is designed to automate the download, orginization, and storage of [GDELT source files](https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html#rawdatafiles). GDELT-Diff includes a daemon that runs every 60 mins fetching any new or missing files and sorts them into folders for easy storage. Additionally, an extremely lightweight tool is provided to maintain a copy of only the streams most recent files in /tmp/gdelt-live. This is for anyone doing real-time analysis of the GDELT and doesn't require a full copy of the source files.

## What is the GDELT?
The GDELT Project is the largest, most comprehensive, and highest resolution open database of human society ever created. Just the 2015 data alone records nearly three quarters of a trillion emotional snapshots and more than 1.5 billion location references, while its total archives span more than 215 years, making it one of the largest open-access spatio-temporal datasets in existance and pushing the boundaries of "big data" study of global human society. Advanced users and those with unique use cases can download the entire underlying event and graph datasets in CSV format. Deep technical knowledge and extensive experience working with large datasets is required to make use of these datasets, with the GKG alone requiring more than 2.5TB of storage compressed.

To learn more about the GDELT and the records that make up its database, check out the [offical documentaion page](https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html#documentation).
